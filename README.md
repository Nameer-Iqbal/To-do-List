# React + Vite
The purpose of this project is to build a simple, interactive to-do list application using React. The application provides an intuitive way for users to manage their tasks by adding and deleting items in a list. This project focuses on front-end as well as back-end development, utilizing React to create an interactive user experience and JavaScript is used for the implication of backend. Moreover, the tasks are later being saved in a database using MongoDB.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
